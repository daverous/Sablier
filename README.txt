To start the game: click UnityFinallEVELuP.exe


The game will only run on a Microsoft Windows (7 or greater) Computer.

The controllers have to be either XBOX 360 or XBOX One controllers. 

This is because the game uses the Microsoft XInput API for improved control mapping. As a result the game requires directx (windows only) to play.
